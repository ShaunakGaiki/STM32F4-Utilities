# STM32F4-Utilities
Utilities and Examples for STM32F4 microcontroller unit.


These are some sample programs for the STM32F4 chip. The code was written on Keil µVision, with the IDE configured for the chip.

The output and input pins that are referenced in the code are based off of the pinout of the Nucleo-F446RE board.

There are some custom functions that I have made that can simplify certain actions (such as serial communication). Their use case is shown in the examples.
